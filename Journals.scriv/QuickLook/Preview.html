<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Mission Statement</p>
<p class="itemText"> Today is not the day my new life starts. It may be the time I am becoming aware of the transition towards a different self, but to even be here writing this means that the seed was already planted and has grown some fruit. Paraphrasing Eric Hoffer, change is not happening when it shows itself. The act of showing change is a manifestation of its already created reality. This has stuck with me since I read it, and this document is the proof.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText"> The effort to be alive feels like a mighty act of courage everyday. Maybe I am finally dealing with the trauma of coming back here, some standard transitioning and some was just crazy shit that just happened to happen. One hopes that their life is like a smooth laminar flow. Smoothly and seamlessly moving from one bend to the other. But mine is like a lake behind a dam. Deep and stagnant. Through much effort, everyday I try to poke a hole in the damn. By the next morning the efficiency city wor...</p>

<p class="itemText">Putting a name to something is incredibly powerful. The heart of alchemy, at least in the EarthSea series. Putting a name to my struggle, BPD or Borderline Personality Disorder, has given me that analytical power. Although I do not think it is the ultimate tool to explain myself, it has proved very useful in the more acute sensations. I have immense feelings. Feels that are bloated and too big for me to handle. My coping mechanisms make sense, as they are all about distracting. My inability to f...</p>

<p class="itemText">Sometimes its amazing how much just changing the name of something can change your life. I am siting in my “clubhouse”. This simply self-narrative tool has made my outlook on my living situation quantifiably better. At least 15%. I feel like this is something that most people experience, but without the need to change the name: the comfort of Home. This is my home. Where I an do more than just get through my emotional experience. Something I can look back at and see the utility and power. My clu...</p>

Stuck with me in that way where you don’t bother to write it down because “it seems so clear”… Im sure that many if not most of ‘mans’ best thoughts were lost this way.

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Darwin's Materialism</p>
<p class="itemText"> While reading Dennet’s “Darwin’s Dangerous Idea” I was reminded of an old train of thought, and am hoping to find it again by exploring the concept here. I was reminded when Dennet explore Locke’s “proof” that the primal being must be of mind, because (paraphrasing) mindless matter could never create mind, therefor it all must have started with mind. This kind of thinking, while forgein in to a modern reader, was par for the course at the time. The mind-body dualism was much more of a tangible ...</p>

<p class="itemText"> I have been pondering a lot on this idea lately that the issues in life are not totally about identifying what’s wrong, and gathering the power to fix it. There is a great and underused power in just simply asking yourself what situation are you in? What the actual problems you are facing, or what should this part of my life be like, as opposed to the broader what should (my) life be like?I am in a situation where my concepts of sexual pair bonding are not where I want them to be.
