\f0\fs26 \cf0 Sometimes its amazing how much just changing the name of something can change your life. I am siting in my \'93clubhouse\'94. This simply self-narrative tool has made my outlook on my living situation quantifiably better. At least 15%. I feel like this is something that most people experience, but without the need to change the name: the comfort of Home. This is my home. Where I an do more than just get through my emotional experience. Something I can look back at and see the utility and power. My club house is where I write, listen to records, and feed myself A home base I can share with my mayo. Such a simple change of perspective can mean wonders. Maybe its the BPD, but it is a powerful tool for myself. To the power of my club house!}
