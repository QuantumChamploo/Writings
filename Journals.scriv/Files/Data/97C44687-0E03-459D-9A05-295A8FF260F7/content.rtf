\f0\fs26 \cf0 	Today is not the day my new life starts. It may be the time I am becoming aware of the transition towards a different self, but to even be here writing this means that the seed was already planted and has grown some fruit. Paraphrasing Eric Hoffer, change is not happening when it shows itself. The act of showing change is a manifestation of its already created reality. This has stuck with me since I read it, and this document is the proof.\

	With this exercise, I hope to reignite the idea explored in the Quantum Alchemist Project. In the process of self discovery, broadly speaking, I am an alchemist. Firmly rooted in science, but aware that the scrubbed and clinical view of experience that it provides is flawed, and missing obvious and apparent concepts that are clear to the experiencer but elusive to the being put to equations and theorems. Life is art, and here I hope to explore myself. 30 min a day, some amount of days in a row, may just change my brain to be the writer and self-possessed person I long to be. Heres Hoping.}
