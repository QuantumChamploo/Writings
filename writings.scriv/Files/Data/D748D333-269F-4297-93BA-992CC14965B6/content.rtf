\f0\fs26 \cf0 Almost emergent:\
	ZFC to All mathematics. Seems like an emirgent properties, but upon inspection the driving force of ZFC is to truly connect the axioms to the theorems. It does not have the bifurcation of information, where the ermigent property occupies substantially distinct informational space. Or another way, the point of axiomatizing mathematics is to make all of it the sum of its axiomatic parts. It is not emergent by this very definition. \
