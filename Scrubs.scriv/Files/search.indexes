            <Text>Scrubs is the best, and worst, show ever written. With the proper narrative structure set up, Scrubs was able to pump out seasons of content, that kept the same gleam through most of its run. By not being chained to realism, it’s“rational” absurdism, it never had to go far to make jokes and reoccurring bits. It is it’s relationship with narrative tools and their disconnect from reality that let it be a glorious cookie cutter, but a cookie cutter just the same. </Text>
